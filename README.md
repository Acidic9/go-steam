# go-steam
Go-Steam is a repository for Steam development in Golang and is planned to contain multiple packages to make developing Steam-related projects as simple and practicable as possible.

### About
I am hoping for this to be a collaborative project with as many contributers as possible.
There is only one package developed so far called steamid which contains function to convert a SteamID from and to any existing format along with resolving a SteamID 64 from a search query. I will be extremely grateful for any ideas and/or contributions.

### Contributing
The official guide [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing) explains in detail how you can contribute to a project.

A quick explination:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Some cool reflection'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
