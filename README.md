# go-steam
Go-Steam is a repository for Steam development in Golang and is planned to contain multiple packages to make developing Steam-related projects as simple and practicable and simple as possible.

### About
Hopefully this project can be a collaborative project with as many contributers as possible.

So far there are two packages, [steamid](steamid) and [steamapi](steamapi). The [steamid](steamid) package is very stable and contains functions for converting a Steam ID to and from the following types: 
 - Community ID
 - ID64
 - ID32
 - ID3

The [steamapi](steamapi) package aims to contain functions for every existing Steam API method available. It still has a little way to go.
